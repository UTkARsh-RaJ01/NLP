Duane De Bruyn,5,"Great password manager and safekeeping of important notes, also has a swift autofill function that works well on all platforms."
Doulos of Christ,5,I used to be a ironvst user but I started using APM because its much better than ironvest.. however its such a shame that I dont know about Avira password manager sooner. Been using Avira service for antivirus since 2008. . Thank you for this app.. The perk using this app is they APM may tell you if your account have been breached and advice you to change your password.

Gianluca Demarchi,5,"Very useful as password saver and authenticator. It can also be set to autofill apps and webpages with saved accounts. Also generic notes and credit cards can be saved in separate lists, aside from passwords. Would love to see an option for saving accounts linked to say google or facebook, and so having the password field not mandatory; another useful field would be ""account name"", as an optional field between this and email. Thanks for the app."
Bob Rozalsky,5,"One of the password managers that is actually good. I switched from Mcafee Truekey as that wasn't working out for me so I decided to look for a new pw manager and this one caught my eye so I tried it out, now its my main pw manager (even for my laptop). Autofill is great, UI is easy to use, Security is strong and it's just 10/10."

Sean Sloan,5,"I am incredibly grateful that Avira gave us this app to use. It is the best password manager out there without all the bloat functions that come with their competitors.

Alfred Wachira,5,"WORKS PERFECTLY.... VERY VERY Convinent and safe to use... Makes getring around your browser and phone faster and easier and most of all, still keeping its safe..."
Kelsey Brewer,5,"Avira is hands down the best password app I have used. On most apps after you save a certain number of passwords you have to pay for more but 145+ passwords and still free. There is also a place for secure notes and debit/credit card info. It also has a password generator that allows you to include/exclude uppercase, numbers, special characters and choose length. It also has two-factor authentication for sensitive info apps/websites/email."

Doggy Diggy,5,Secure and easy to use password manager. Now you can forget about using same passwords across to multiple accounts...
Kane Alkoraghooli,5,When logging in sometimes. It shows I have ZERO data/passwords. Stopped recognising my Master Password. doesn't let me change it after loging in with biometric credentials. And now I cannot use my passwords on any other device.
A Google user,5,"easy to use , secure and fast!"
Russell Moss,5,Great at auto fill. No problems so far
Yoyo Fernandez,5,More than two years using this password manager and there is nothing I can complain about. It does what it has to do.
A. Sanders,5,"Avira Pro is ABSOLUTELY Every androids users COMPLETE PROTECTION PACKAGE! For ($12 i see believe) the One Year package contains Everything(literally) one will need for complete Conrtole of everything!, &&! 12 months of no Mal,and hacking on the Device ~PER.IOD!~ That's just my opinion on the product. I love it personally im on my 2nd year of 'Avira Pro' -n- wouldn't have it another way! -Sincerely: Aaron Sanders. Avira give me promos A/O Cupons PLZ"
Lydie Griffiths,5,Easy to use and intuitive. Very handy.
S.H.,5,This app does not mess about. Very accurate and interface friendly. I am at a point that now I cannot do without this kind of interface integration to save 30 odd passwords I have. Any time I need to change a password or get a new one generated this does it seamlessly. Make this one stay please. All my fingers are thumbs up !!
Dei Enslin,5,"Extremely effective and easy to use, love it"
Lauren Ipsum,5,Works perfectly nowadays :) totally saves me from the regular password hassle
Thomas Wening,5,I have been using Avira PWM for two years now and I am very satisfied with this product. I am managing all my passwords with it and the generators for my accounts with 2FA. Adobe PWM is very reliable and adds a lot of security to my accounts. I can only recommend trying it out.
Martin,5,Is very simple and works great. Not sure if I can group passwords but I just manually named them in groups. Overall 9/10.
Adil yassia,5,Prob.. resolved. Just a review: It will be better if you add a hand drag drop on the wallet where can reorganize the entries into folders
Hayden McKessner,5,Excellent free password manager! Works seamlessly across devices and is very convenient for 2FA.
Kevin C,5,Brilliant. The built in authenticator is useful too.
Omar Badr,5,Amazing password manager. Does everything I need and does it well. I especially like that it has 2fa.
A Google user,5,Saves me time and very user friendly.
Ted Donovan,5,"Have tried numerous other password managers, this is hands down the very best! Easy to set up and works flawlessly every time!"
A Google user,5,"I like all avira product. Simple, work great!"
Angel Taylor,5,Life changing how helpful this app is -especially across platforms!
Binyo Kin,5,It frequently signs out requiring frequent sign in. Being generous with a free services as well as smooth functionality is why I give full 5 ⭐✨⭐
Darrin Chung,5,"Excellent, love having everything at the push of a button."
Wookiee Rage,5,Makes my access seamless between multiple devices.
A Google user,5,"I find this password manager works flawlessly, better than lasspass.. would recommend you try it out and see if it does what you want it to do.... for me definitely worth the five stars."
William Jr Cunanan,5,"update. i changed to other password manager , but i keep coming back for this. this is still much better."
A Google user,5,since year's the best antivirus software! l use it since 1978!
Kushal Kaushik,5,"I am very happy with this password manager, I used a few others before this one.. but I like Avira the best.. the free version here allows me 2 devices connected at the same time.. which is super cool. And the overall user experience is also very smooth. 5 stars would recommend to everyone."
Gary Griffiths,5,Best Password Manager I have ever used. Also includes 2FA support all in one app.
Norma Price,5,Works great! I still have a problem with it recognizing some apps and websites without entering my Master Passcode but once I do it's fantastic
Claire N Destine,5,It's so nice to have a fully functional password manager as a free version <3
Claire N Destine,5,"By far the best experience I've had with the free version of a password manager app. Poor people deserve fully functioning services too <3 Thanks so much, Avira!"
Clayton Werner,5,Works great on my PC & android
A Google user,5,"I think the best password manager out there. Has 2-way verification that no one else has. also includes a two way verification app so you have 2 apps in one and syncs it on all devices, thats the best. Informs you when a account has been breached (only pro version). The only think that I would like to have is clear the clipboard after a few seconds or minutes. Update Apr 2019: The autofill function is nit working for me. I don't know why. Also the clipboard is not working."
A Google user,5,I love Avira I have been using avira internet secuity pro for more than 10 years it's always been good I recently purchased Avira optomiser it's as good as Avira internet security pro which I use it on my 2 device I am sure Avira password manager is as good. All Avira products are top shelf don't think 2 times to download them. Thanks Avira for lovely Apps :--)
DragonKnight HeroTey,5,"Generates, saves, quality of life is good most places."
Fatih Sezer,5,Works very best and stable. I liked it.
Compu Freek,5,Full featured and convenient. Works well and does exactly what I need.
Giuseppe Gaviani,5,"Avira is an excellent, easy to use password manager where you can store over 100 passwords for free"
A Google user,5,"JUST STARTED USING IT A FEW WEEKS AGO, BUT SO FAR SO GOOD. EASY TO USE AND I LOVE THE APP LOCK!!"
Jonathan Borsellino,5,Excellent app to store all username and passwords.
Nimo India,5,App works well. Easy and quick to use.
Anthony Gonsalves,5,Easy to use just like the browser page.
nishiki,5,I've been using Avira Password Manager for a few years and I've been quite satisfied with it!
Adam TR,5,"From a reputable company, keeps all your passwords accessible everywhere you go across phone to pc. Only wish is that 2fa also saved your codes remotely"
Peter Lawton,5,Excelent app apart from inap adds i am paying for premium service .
Sandra Peters,5,Great potential bu extremely difficult to navigate the horrendous complexity.
Nick Brincat,5,"The service is great on my PC...... I'm an avira Prime user and the app temporarily wouldn't let me log in. Seems everyone was affected. Left a review here like everyone else, Avira responded and a day later the issue was fixed! Best of all my 2FA was saved so I didn't loose anything! Thank you Guys, great service!"
Ron Koh,4,Useful app! No more remembering passwords though sometimes you would have to remember to add in those passwords.
Michiel 'Kader' Witkamp,4,"Good service, reliable but does update often and logs you out after (usually when it's inconvenient)"
A Google user,4,How to reset this master password in this shame apps
Ernesto Rivera,4,Excellent
ogle ogler,4,"Great. A pattern lock would be good. It only uses biometric and the actual password, no option for pattern password."
Sergio Short,4,Good so far for laptop
Cléber Macieski,4,"Great tool! Could use more flexible ways of passwords creation, like only uppercase or just numbers."
Norris Nam,4,"When adding password, it saves url and name in case sensitive correctly. But when editing a password, it auto convert url and name to normal case, cause problem can not auto fill to app."
G Viswanatha Reddy,4,"From today it stopped working on mobile, but works file in pc. First it shows no password on mobile app, but after trying closing and opening 3/4 times, it has shown passwords but not synching with pc."
Murat Sahin,4,"web or chrome extension works very well so far. but android mobile app does not recognize or entering to the server. And after few hours, just started working... thnks.."
A Google user,4,"Only 4 stars because one thing I don't like about its feature is it doesn't accept subdomain. Please note that in an organization, there are subdomain websites and each of its sites may have different accounts/credentials."
Subho Roy,4,"Kindly inform me, Avira password manager all features is absolutely free for users? Have any hidden charges for free user? Otherwise your password manager features is very helpful. Browser extension not work properly."
Justin Jackman,4,So far so good 👍
David Wagner,4,An error has occurred. Please try again later. This is all I get when trying to log in. Update: working now. It appears that the above message is after too many attempts....maybe
Ethan Lewis,4,Very good. I like the auto fill. Only problem is that you have to manually add the passwords rather than them asking to add it.
A Google user,4,so far its good
A Google user,4,"good app. one of the improvement what I expect is, manual sync button because I don't know whether it is already sync with web site or not"
Ron P.,4,"Nice password wallet. It sometimes is a bit reluctant to pop-up when entering a login page, especially with Firefox."
Beth Fechner,4,"Great way to generate and store passwords. A bit glitchy on Android phone with Auto log-in using firefox browser, Chrome fine."
Jonathan Armstrong,4,very handy- i like the way it syncs between all my devices and PC's. However on my android smartphone it only auto-enters my passwords about half the time which is a bit annoying.
Gildas Mamona,4,Wonderful app
anyi madu,4,Awesome app
Flavio Barboni,4,"É bom, mas precisa melhorar algumas coisas pra superar o LastPass, tipo a necessidade de ter que ficar abrindo a extensão no Chrome em nova aba para consultar senhas de sites. Também sinto falta do desbloqueio das senhas por digital no celular, igual ao Samsung Pass."
Romi Donis,4,They should improve the stability how to be checked to collect the passwords in order as you needed all the time to log in back in the app ;( this take time huh
Dao Fo,4,Good
Franklin A. Toribio Maria,4,"Excellent in almost everything, but their support for subdomains passwords is painful, please try to make it more neat and simple to use"
J A,4,"Great App but it seems to log me out intermittently so i find myself having to log back in to it way too frequently, which is inconvenient."
Stevan Gaskill,4,"It's working pretty good, but unfortunately does not update well between the app and the website"
Elizabeth Gibson,4,So far I have found this app very good.😊
Charlie Mowbray,4,Great little app for storing passwords. Convenient and easy to use. Only minor gripe is that very occasionally (three times over a couple of years) the app wont let me log in and I then have to use the web based version which isn't formatted well for mobile use.
Salem “Salyoo” Regodon,4,"No star, it is not functioning."
Ziaul Haque,4,Why I Don't Get Loging otp Code...?
Bhavish Moody,4,"Everything good, just that I'm on android 8.0 and I would love a dark mode for the App!! Please work that devs! Cheers"
Jose Nunes (Trucker Joe),4,Sort of kind of works Rob forn is better
Adib Sulthon Muammal,4,Some password may changed if exported and then imported again using csv
A Google user,4,I love this app but how can I change my master pw?
Charles D,4,"This app is great and very user friendly. I do have one problem, when I remove the check mark from Autofill login in forms to disable it, there is no other option for signing in. Was expecting to just click on the user name and password and the information would be applied. Everything I read says autofill big security problem."
A Google user,4,Likeing it thank you
A Google user,4,I've tested a number of psssword managers and Avira is one of the best. Auto fill and sync works well on both Android and Windows. Unlike other free versions there are no limits to the number of log ins you can store. It also as an authentication module for 2FA to save the need for a separate app. Needs a password generator then it'd be 5 stars.
A Google user,4,"Just OK,But sometimes too late."
A Google user,4,"Avira PWM is the best. I can store unlimited number of passwords, unlike other well known password managers. I can log-in to websites AND apps using Avira. Also it syncs across all my devices. It has a password generator. There are note,too. All this completely free. What more can you ask for? Edit: decreased one star because the notes section is buggy. When I press on any part of a note it scrolls to the top. Makes note editing very difficult. Fix it and it'll be five stars again. All the best."
A Google user,4,I prefer no password for one-time password section
A Google user,4,Just started using it. Have used avira antivirus for a decade.i am a fan of avira. deducted one star as it doesn't have fingerprint unlock
A Google user,4,it is a nice app... but doesn't work with Bing and Edge browser...
A Google user,4,"Useful and helpful password manager,"
A Google user,4,good experience
I Ogbonna,4,User friendly
Ernesto Sazo,4,So far satified with the many ablities of the app will provide a full review in the near future .
A Google user,4,Updated to four stars after broken app was fixed.
something,4,"Pretty straight forward to use, but, on some apps the auto fill doesn't work, so you have to manually past in the password, and, there is no way (that I know of without premuim) to find out what accounts have been breached/have a bad password, it will only say that an account is breached and than show a blurred icon of the app"
Sonik Shah,4,Data is not visible after update
md azhar,4,👍
Yours Truly,4,👍
Pam Varone,4,Cannot figure out how to log out of app
Muhammad Noman Hafeez,4,Best password manager but its loads slow.
A Google user,4,"hi, it would be great that once we on web protection and PWM it should be on unless we off so i think it would be great. thanks"
Demetri Loizou,4,"Not perfect, but better than nothing"
A Google user,4,Feature Request: Allow to import passwords from a CSV file. Chrome allows you to export passwords in CSV format. Can you ads this feature to read this file and import all passwords in one go?
Jacek,4,"Great. However... after going to ultra power saving mode in a Samsung device and going back, the Avira PM requests to enable it in services etc. despite it's already priviliged - so I need to disable it an then enable again. Observed on M51 and Tab S6 Lite Happens each time."
Nick Ball,4,Great on a laptop. I like being able to lock the passwords and having to sign-in again as passwords are important enough to warrant constant awareness. The auto filling of log in details on the mobile doesn't always work.
Daniel Steck,4,Underrated app with comprehensive free version. My sole qualm is it only provides an autofill service and most Android browsers have really bad autofill API integration. That isn't really Avira's fault but other password managers solve this issue through an additional accessibility service.
Paul Irvine,4,"I've been using it for ages and its great but suddenly today when I try and log on via my android by the app it keeps trying to bring up a captcha and sends me a code via text but just keeps repeating this, never allowing me to log on until it complains of too many attempts and says try later... Sometimes the captcha shows but most times not, you just see some text re one but no actual captcha.. Now its doing it on the PC..Shows an error 400 which I presume is a page not found.."
Marlon Parker,4,"Cool app, so far. Give it a try. 👍"
HandsomeCarrot,4,My browser extension is working perfectly. Just my app is weird. I am connected with the same account and I have all the passwords. The problem: they don't load and if they do I see only some weird signs so it is not working properly.
A Google user,4,Wonderful
Jorge Córdoba Illescas,4,One of the best free multidevice passwords managers
Steve Turnbull,4,"An excellent password generation and management program. The only complaint I have is that it the auto-fill isn't consistently seamless. Maybe once a week I'll have to copy and paste the password ... but overall, this is an excellent tool and moreover because it is free."
SUBHADEEP ROYCHOWDHURY,4,"Please let me know, how to work Avira password manager when I open my mail account on browser?"
Matthew Owens,4,I hope this one dosent fail me like sticky password did
Paul T Jenkins,4,Apps of this type used to allow copying an entire entry and duplicating that copy into a new entry. That would be a great feature and a time saver as well.a
VINCENT ANDREW LOBO,4,"One of the few best password managers offers strong pw, warns on the strength of the pw, fingerprint unlock makes accessibility easier. In short it's dependable and safe. Auto filling of pw is still a issue and does not happen all the sites. Otherwise would rate it high among the top five."
A Google user,4,Awesome!!!!
S MUNI HARISH (hari),4,I am using this service or app since 2019.I facing the automatic logout issue since 2019.I am still waiting for solution.Please i request @Avira team to solve the issue in next update.
A Google user,4,Decent app
Devjit Banerjee,3,Trying out the free tier of Avira PWM at the moment. I cannot say about others but i personally have liked the experience so far. Auto fill works good with Chrome. I'm assuming it will with Edge Chromium too. Separate toggles for app auto fill and browser auto fill is very much appreciated. Suggestions: 1. The phone apps dont seem to have a password generator and I think a password generator should be added. 2. The cost of the pro subscription seems a bit high (considering Bitwarden's price)
A Google user,3,"Good Product, Not compatible with KeePass. It would be great to open a KeePass DB and populate this password manager. No Credit Card option neither. Sophos can do all this but It is in the UK and they are not so strict with Data Protection laws like Germany."
A Google user,3,The application don't open  Can you help me?
Oh Baa,3,Ok laaa👍
Raechell Hurtado De Mendoza,3,"great when it works, but finicky and frustrating. edit: its finicky and frustrating because the password manager doesn't recognize a lot of fields where i need to put a password in or suggest a strong password and it wont save said strong password, so i have to go into the app instead of just signing in. the mobile version regularly just signs me out every thirty seconds sometimes."
George Kehas,3,"The app is inconsistent. I use it on 3 devices, my phone, tablet & laptop. Works pretty well on the laptop but sketchy on the other 2. It often doesn't fill fields, I have to go into the app to use it or just get the info for the account and enter it myself."
YJ Lin,3,I generally like this app for password. I need to lower my rating because since I switch phone to a pixel3axl I had a few times that I am unable to unlock the master password simply because the keyboard won't pop open.
maha kattarnark,3,Installation and registration for this app on my laptop was easy ... But inexplicably the playstore version for Android took forever to download ... The laptop version often makes errors when saving details of multiple accounts from the same provider (eg: gmail) ... So be careful to double-check what exactly is being saved!
A Google user,3,I have to reinstall the app to sync any changes in my my browser!
Curtis Carr,3,Edit: lowering my rating only because the app has doesn't play well with Firefox. I normally struggle to use the Avira button in Firefox often giving up and taking back to the copy/paste feature for entering credentials I strongly recommend this app to everyone. There is not a person reading this comment that wouldn't benefit from using Avira Password Manager. Works virtually almost perfectly with all of my apps and sites.
A Google user,3,"The application is the best one so far but there are some issues. It is not working properly sometimes on some specific applications. And also, it is popping up at some applicatios that shouldn't do. At ""Steam"" application, it is popping up at chatbox that you send messages to someone else. Could you please fix the issue? Thank you :) addition2: open avira password manager text pops up almost in every nickname and password textboxes but also in Steam app. Android 9 Xiaomi user"
Dan Joos,3,"Okay, there 2 reasons why there is 3 stars here. The first is an issue for those of us who want to lock down sensitive data more than just a password, facial recognition, pattern, or finger print. There is no support for a Yubico dongles and other such keys. The 2nd, and not as important, is support for more browser integration. Because of a lack of browsers that it works with, I have to use Chrome and others like it other wise I don't have that ability to utilize APM to its fullest."
A Google user,3,"It can feel a lil clunky, especially when trying to change passwords to a generate one from the app. This app would benefit the user if it could export the passwords, like you can with Google chrome."
Yom Kipper,3,Confusing security
Xiang Yang Cai,3,"This has been my favorite password management tool. However, I was recently forced to relogin and can't get an verification code anymore. I am from Philippines, pls advise."
A Google user,3,"Please add functionality to completely wipe an account if i can prove that it is my email being used for sign in, and create it again blank. Forgot master password and now the app is useless"
A Google user,3,"Where is the password generator. I have spent 4 hours sorting my logins etc 
out but no generator."
A Google user,3,Seems a work in progress as doesn't seem to integrate with Firefox on android. Works fine with Firefox on Windows though. Hopefully an update is coming as seems pretty slick otherwise.
Basil L,3,"Hi. Dear Avira team, help me understand why you are not answering me? I described my problem by email and got a mail from yours with some kind of a service number [7GQ6XE-EE6QM]. I added more info by mail later but still nothing from you."
A Google user,3,My master password works on google chrome on my pc but does not work on my android device?  Is this a bug?
A Google user,3,Good
A Google user,3,Registering a new Avira account using this app could effectively avoid the password complexity requirements...
Chris Tellow,3,"2.10 have bug,it show prepare your password angin and angin, can't login"
sue howlett,3,Stopped working on android phone. Cannot log in on app but avira password vault does recognize my credentials on a browser with URL. App fails after displaying a captcha message but never displays a captcha challenge. Server just responds invalid email or password. It was great when it was working and way ahead of some other vault offerings for android. Doesn't appear to have a support option on the avira website.
Len Kowalik,3,"I could not get it to fill in a user ID for an app, yet it was able to fill in the password. Autofill for another password manager worked fine. I have posted on the community forum. Waiting for a reply."
Michael Bonner,3,Repeatedly have to sign in. Too many times.
A Google user,3,"Love the app, but lately it looks up,which is really cumbersome. Since I work in the field of UI/ UX I have detected some small things that could be more consistent and work better. But on average the app is super and I would recommend it to friends."
David Luke,3,"Needs an auto generator built into the Android app. Also randomly forgets it's logged in and shows a blank list when I tap on the pop-up from my browser. Then when I open the app, it's still logged in, so it wasn't a security timeout."
K P,3,The best 😎
A Google user,3,Why has malware
A Google user,3,"Good application. Very useful but sometimes, the fingerprint unlock is not available and I have to use my master password which is quite long and complicated. It is also very difficult to see the difference between the lowercase l and the number 1 when you want to see a password. Autofill feature is annoying take too much space on the screen."
A Google user,3,"I wish that it was compacted in two one then it would be the best app 
please consider the update to the change Cher's"
A Google user,3,"Very mixed. When it works its great, but the mobile app is frustrating. It seems to offer autofill at random. It doesn't update passwords when they are changed. It's just far too erratic for day to day use. I will uninstall & teplace."
C Schutz,3,"I don't know why but often it just doesn't pop up with username and password to fill in my apps and website passwords. And one thing I would truly like to see in this app is to unlock it with a pattern or pincode. But generally otherwise I like the ease of use and the fact that you can also write notes for the particular websites and apps. And I like Avira, having used their products for many years."
Indellable,3,Ugly black bars line the sides of the app in landscape mode. I'm going to just use the website.
Chad Luhar,3,Can't access my notes when offline.
A Google user,3,a suggestion for your good app: we want add attach file to some website profiles and categorize them.
Tom (Brisil),3,"I really like using this app, but I could do without the notification every 15 seconds telling me the service is enabled. Please fix that"
oliver anthony resurreccion,3,"Very nicely Done AVIRA. But I don't have money for your PRO version, uninstalling now."
Phil Steele (Azureroth),3,If PWM would only sync between my devices I would give you 5 stars. If it does I can't find it
Bivash Gain (Bapi),3,I don't know what is going on with this app. I can't login with my phone but I can log in with dextop..is this a bug or anything . Please resolve this issue.
Michael Morgan,3,Constantly will not pop up in apps or webpages to allow me to autofill have to open avira app login then copy passwords.
Marion Svendrowski,3,Retains a retarded portrait mode even on a tablet
A Google user,3,"Good, as a password manager, but just noticed a small flaw, cannot distinguish between a zero 0 and a capital O, would be easy to correct."
A Google user,3,useful but the web interface is slow to load and the autofill option on mobile tends to get in the way rather than help.
Paloma P.,3,"I would like a 2 step verification to the avira account through QR code to log in option, option to import/export selected passwords to move to different accounts of password managers, offline password manager option, pin to unlock option !. thank you!"
Marcelo Lavor,3,Seems not working fine with Xiaomi 12T PRO
A Google user,3,"This app is ok, but it requires a password prior to opening. That's better than trying to remember so many different passwords, but much less convenient than if it just opened whenever you need it. Also, it does not open for every site and is often unable to follow when a new password is needed. The PC version is a bit better than the android version. But, they both need improvement"
Can,3,It crashes my os whenever i use it on walmart app. Please fix it. Android 8.0.0 stock version.
Kinyo Mer,3,No longer able to receive sms on 2 step authentication
Remember The Fallen,3,Up until the latest release I enjoyed using this app however I can no longer sign in to my account using it. Everytime I try I keep getting an error message below the email field that says INVALID EMAIL FORMAT. My email address hasn't changed
Becky Young,3,I just down loaded this app on my phone can the app be downloaded onto my desktop/laptop as well? can't seem to download on computer
Felipe Diaz,3,"Lately it doesn't synchronize the passwords that I save in my browser to the Android app, I add them on the web and it doesn't show in the app... Help!"
hg murty,3,Interface looks kinda washed out. Auto fill not the best out there but does the job. No TOTP on pc? Which is a bummer
mohamed zeyada,3,"التطبيق فيه بعض الأخطاء أهم خطأ هو عندما أحاول تسجيل الدخول يكتب لى حدث خطأ، حاول في وقت لاحق يعنى أنى لاأستطيع تشغيله والاستفادة منه أصلا Whenever I try to log into the app , it tells me"" an error has occurred, please try again later""."
MELIANI Driss,3,idk why i can't login!
Karen Essay,3,Dosen't work well on laptop
Cody Haggarty,3,App not working can not login or can not add passwords
Salindu Hansaka,3,"Everything is good on web app, but mobile app i cant login."
Ali Bastami,2,"I am using the PRO version and it lacks a lot of features and already has a lot of issues like: a standalone password suggestion like in Kaspersky, poor password management (PW and usernames can't be saved automatically), You can't suggest a password during a registration .. and many more. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
Neeraj Tripathi,2,"Even though I am a Prime member with Password Pro subscription, the app doesn't recognises the license."
MastART,2,Couldn't import a csv file. Therefore useless to me
Juampi Zanin,2,"Not so good. Does not recognize the log in page for several web sites. The passwords generator not always shows up and most of the times it is useless since it doesn't follow the characters allow in each website ergo I end it up creating my own password the majority of times, And sometimes this new password are not saved in the app, you have to enter it manually.... I do not recommend this app at all I think there are much better lotions out there such as dashlane which I will go back soon"
Erik Tharsis Rossbach,2,"App is in general okay, but frequently freezes in the login screen and does not let me type my password. This happened on my Galaxy s6 and Fairphone 3. Also, the autocomplete function sometimes appears as an option and sometimes not. I would give it 5 stars if the login and autocomplete function always worked."
Kyle Strasser,2,"Paid for subscription, and yet the app says I still need to upgrade to pro..."
Matt Hummel,2,"I'm beginning to feel going with Prime was a mistake. There is no advantage to Prime compared to not having it, you are still nickel and dimed for the apps and services Avira claims you have access to. This app is a great example it's telling me to get pro. What a crock."
Pigman,2,For some reason the app will not offer to save new password or offer to create new passwords it just throws up this annoying pop-up saying there is no password saved for this site. This frustrating pop-up covers the box where you are to type passwords and it pops up every time you refresh.which is kinda the reason why ICanceled my subscription. If it would at least offer to save the new password that you just created then it wouldn't be so bad. But it doesn't. The pc ver works OK though
Scott McLachlan,2,Was doing fine up until recently. I checked my passwords on my phone but the app has lost all my passwords and doesn't sync to the desktop version... 😕👎
A Google user,2,"Not all passwords are for internet sites so I cant understand, why each password u put in has to have a web address?!"
Roy Grantham,2,"When it doesn't open, you're stuffed!!!"
Harrison J,2,"App started out great. Everything that I needed. But after a while passwords would not update across multiple devices. And then when I open the app absolutely no passwords come up, meaning the entire password databases blank. Inexplicable errors that make the entire system unusable unfortunately. I'll probably give it another week to see if the developers fix these issues then I'll simply move to another system. I would be willing to pay for a quality app"
james maina,2,"The previous app was functional but after the update, I am unable to login in my account, can someone assist with the Password manager for Android"
Chris Aitchison-Knight,2,Not the most user friendly and support are terrible
Indellable,2,Can no longer copy a newly create password
A Google user,2,Well it keeps crashing when I'm trying to get my passwords...
Mr B Google,2,Rubbish this is. Doesn't autofill passwords for Google accounts.
Siphiwe Sikhakhane,2,Doesn't open when you put master password. No error indicating the problem whether the password is wrong or not.
A Google user,2,PWM popup is close in other login apps. Pls fix. I Useing LG H540
Franc Barz,2,"Using on Firefox (desktop and mobile) it either doesn't pop up to auto fill at all or there's a very quick Avira pop up that instantly disappears when I tap in the username or password box, either way I always have to navigate away from the browser find avira find the username and password copy them and navigate back to the log in page. It never autofills credit card details either and It also never offers to save new passwords and there's no password generator"
A Google user,2,Give me a chance to use it please.
Samano “Samano” Lai,2,"Why can't I log in, on and off have this kind of problem, really annoying."
A Google user,2,"Coming from Avira, I had high expectations for this app. It turned out to be a huge disappointment. Has fewer features than others password managers that are free. The UI is nice though."
A Google user,2,"From an usability standpoint this might be a decent solution : have a central repository from which to get your passwords. From a privacy standpoint, using them is suicide. The next time the governmental organisations ask, or some disgruntled employee wants to shame them, or Russian hackers hack in, or some tired system administrator publicly exposes a whole database to the Internet, or 1000 other cases your data will be readily available to anyone who happens to know where to look."
A Google user,2,Have to uninstall it if I want to fill out certain forms devoid of passwords!
Scott Zupek,2,"UPDATE on 01-14-2021: The Tablet (which is CHROME browser all the way) experience is a BAD. ...No ""suggest password"" option(browser) ...No landscape support ...No plugin option (i usually use Firefox which is lightyears better than chrome, except on android, which it's generally a trash experience) ...CONSTANTLY have to put in master password and even then, still same OG:Unable to use more than 1 Google account from phone. So no option for business and personal on the same phone. Super annoying"
Chris Brown,2,"The website access does not stay on, therefore I have to keep setting it."
Chen Jinkerson,2,"Does not work offline, no option to force the password prompt to show, same goes for the password generator"
A Google user,2,Sometimes irritating banner appears at the bottom of the screen for infinite number of times. (Avira password manager service enabled ) 😭
Cute Boy,2,Pretty bad
Joseph Chen,2,"Inconsistent ability to automatically fill in password fields; often need to copy and paste, which is very inconvenient. Also not great at managing multiple userids/passwords per URL, or unique URLs by port number."
Marinos Savva,2,It looks nice and its easy to use but it doesnt sync your data on multiple devices.
Ganiyu Olayiwola,2,"I have been using this app for over two months with no problem. However, I am unable to see my saved passwords and the interface is like I never even used the app before."
Seth,2,Very capable of storing passwords but the autofill feature just doesn't work even after enabling it in settings. Works fine as a chrome extension on desktop though.
A Google user,2,Logged out of my account now everytime I try and login again it keeps sending the code to my old phone number if you can contact me to solve this issue then I might give it a better rating
Mike Lester Rosales,2,"Super slow and buggy when you have 1400+ passwords and counting, even on Pro version. Disappointed as a Prime customer"
E B,2,Doesn't recognise certain apps. Struggles on mobile device to suggest password when signing up. Notes has very little to no functionality (selecting text /editing etc) Thought I had a solution there. Sadly not
Glenn Colthart,2,"Terrible I assumed my passwords were downloaded into my Avira Acct. Not a single p/w was saved. Also,feedback feature not showing how to be in touch with Avira support. No password create site Disappointing!"
A Google user,2,is the autofill really working? i cant get it to work on browser (samsung internet in s7 edge) i already enabled a lot of thing but there's no luck at all. samsung pass suddenly says I've rooted my device (I didn't root it or anything) and it wont work anymore and i really need some autofill service because it's really pain to type my long äss passwords every time.
A Google user,2,"Was great until recently update. Now I can no longer add tags. When I make a tag, click the plus icon, go back and they've disappeared. Also, it doesn't even tell you what you get with pro. It literally just says upgrade."
Vishwaksen Reddy Dhareddy,2,"The application worked fine for about 2 months but was soon as I updated it, app my data was gone. Soo bad on your part avira. I thought it to be legit and reliable but it proved a big no."
Joe Douglas,2,Was really great when it worked but lately it constantly crashes and doesn't seemy to be syncing passwords.
Kingslords Socialmedia,2,Doesn't let me log in anymore! Liked it when it worked but I will have to switch to Last Pass. I need a PWM that I know will work whenever I need it. Not being able to log in is just not acceptable for a PWM.
Dj Hogg,2,Not as good as it used to be
A Google user,1,requires sign up! no offline use
Charlie Ng,1,"Completely non functioning, the beta version will just tell me there is no Internet connection, release version will tell you there is something wrong. Can't even login to submit diagnostic data."
Peter W,1,This morning I woke up and learned that I can't reach my account because Avira is applying sanctions. It'd be great if at least some warning message was sent. Anyhow by using a cheap VPN I could reach my passwords and delete my account. Hope we won't see each other in future. Thanks for everything...
A Google user,1,Do nothing on android and not auto fill on chrome
Vipin Rohit,1,worst app...totally worthless... saved my very important note and it gets vanished the other day...seriously..the app is a bad joke!!!
Husam Almasry,1,I cannot believe that there is a company so stupid to venture into passwords with a stupid and unusable app. It stopped working without justification and was not even completing the steps to reset the account. Now I am unable to log in to my bank account or any other account.. Disappointing
A Google user,1,"No longer works on Android 10. I can login using fingerprint, but I can't login thru typing master password, I can't click on Menu Bar, Authentication and other features"
A Google user,1,Atill cant figure out hiw tge hell this works Keeps popping up wherever you  type in your email add. Any email add ftm
Andrew Ladym,1,Tge app forgot my password. I DID NOT FORGET MY PASSWORD YOUR APP DID. THANKS FOR NOTHING.
Shreedharan V,1,"Apparently, the avira password manager does not save my passwords for some reason."
Chun-yien Chang,1,the new update seems to break the app...can't login with all my phones with the latest update.
Rafe Eubanks,1,"They lost all of my passwords this morning and I cant reach customer service. If I have to write my passwords down and keep them some place safe, then why am I paying for this service?"
Oles,1,"Avira bloked in Ukraine sms and didn't inform me in time when I have 2FA mode on. I could not login into accound and cancel my subscription, delete my bank card or copy passwords. They couldn't help and continue use my money and private data even after my request to delete my account according GDPR rights."
Sol Stice,1,The app cannot even reinstall after uninstall. Useless.
D Singleton,1,"I had an issue with sign in and syncing passwords between app and browser extension. I emailed them (there is no other way to contact them) and had this reply ""I have checked your email address in our database, and unfortunately I couldn't find any active Avira licenses for this account. Please keep in mind that we can only offer email and telephone support to customers using our premium products."" So unless you buy a license they won't help. I'm ditching for a different app."
katrīna,1,"App was great until a few weeks ago it started CONSTANTLY freezing after logging in. And nothing helps - I tried re-installing it, restarting my phone. It was a little annoying at first, but now it happens half of the times I try to use it. And auto-fill function doesn't work properly - it either doesn't show up at all for some websites or offers to ""save my password"" when I set my alarm clock."
Alan Downey,1,"Updated and I lost everything. Prompted me to login (ignoring that I setup biometrics) and didn't recognize my master password. No way too recover my password with the free version, so I lost all my passwords. Uninstalled."
One 4All,1,Card scanning do not work at all
Rohan Manandhar,1,I cannot access to my own account. It says connecting to google and stops working. All my credentials are locked inside.
Nabeel Abdul Jaleel,1,Unable to login
Emily Pyers,1,"I really like the idea of this. Sadly, it doesn't do in real life What it does in my head. There's no option to import passwords in the app. I tried logging in to the Web app to see if it was possible there, but it doesn't accept either one of the two passwords required. It won't automatically save any passwords that are autofilled from my browser (firefox) either. I'm not going to be able to commit to copying and pasting every. single. password. into the app - it's just too cumbersome."
Luiz Garrido,1,It's not working anymore. My passwords don't show up.
Bhavesh Umraniya,1,Autofill is not working even after giving all the permission
amit,1,"I put my pwd in the app ,but now all pwd are deleted automatically.."
A Google user,1,"Purchased Avira Prime. PWM never works, every feature you have to download separately. Can't get any help at all. Just a horrible experience."
RADIUM,1,If you don't have have internet your passwords are unaccessible and if you turn off sync it only stores passwords offline and you cannot export them you have to literally write down each and every password by yourself what a waste

A Google user,1,"I cannot login into mobile. Same account i used from pc. I use yahoo mail. Pc ok, Mobile Not. Please advice."
Roberto Ruiz,1,Cannot login into mobile devices. Poor app.
Mr Leon (The Specialist),1,"I would look somewhere else to store passwords. * passwords dont update across devices * i cant login in this app on android , it keeps saying there is no mobile data, which is absurd. I am also using wifi , same thing. * On the iPhone version, you can log in, but all passwords are blank * On desktop, it's ok. I think It was good before , somewhere you guys are dropping the ball.this app was actually good, and I recommend this like to everyone."
Stephen Wilkinson,1,"Appalling technical support. I got a new device and logged out of my old one. Tried logging into PWM on new device keep getting the error ""no internet connection"". Tried to log into PWM on my old device, to see if that worked. Nope, get the same error. Go through all the usual troubleshooting steps, uninstall, restart device etc etc. Nothing works. So I opened a ticket. Explained the problem and told them all the steps I'd tried. Only to get a generic response asking me to try the same steps"
Nabil oins 3,1,Not getting verification SMS In Bangladesh. Please fix this
Henrike Tietjen,1,"Worked fine for a while but for some reason, whenever I type in my master password, it now doesn't let me log in and shows me an error, saying that there's no internet connection even though the internet works just fine for every other app on my phone."
Brian Smyth,1,Great until I changed smartphone. Everytime I try entering the password it says. NO internet connection. Can't find a way of rectify it. No helping hand in ways of support contact. I'll need to cancel and start all over again with another company.
jack Christopher,1,I haven't used it yet but I see you guys responded with thank you for your positive feedback to a negative review! Do you even read your reviews? Not a good start!
shanker udayan,1,They make you to subscribe premium with passwords locked in it . Unable to contact support team unless you're a premium customer. Please don't go for it :( . Review edited
steven odorcic,1,"Not good at all. Doesn't fill in or ask to save password most of the time, kinda temperamental, and that's the for the premium version."
A Google user,1,Very Disappointing You Cannot Trust This App If You Forgot Your Master Password Then You Cannot Reset It Your All Passwords Will Be Deleted
Saurabh T,1,"Hi team, Recently facing issue as not able to login into account. Tried clearing cache,re login into account. It just says preparing password. Please assist"
krejziceek,1,Google chrome extension doesn't sync with mobile app.
Belal Elgalad,1,I tried many and many times to change the master password it gives connection error ! Rather than changing the password
Stanley G.,1,The most important thing about an app like these is that is has to work and remember password...after a update it says hey 0 password safed ....what a huge Shi. . Spending now half a day to make everywhere new passwords . Then better write them again on a piece of paper
ANIRUDH G,1,If accidentally deleted any password. It is getting permanently deleted instead of going to recycle bin
TAA,1,Not working .. In pc version when i sign in to account automatically sign out ✅😒
Google User,1,What personal data you need. I not subscribed. Is free version I am using. Doesn't work on S10 Plus mobile. Works on Samsung Galaxy S7 tho. It only is Android 8. S10 Plus is now update to Android 11. See what I mean? Should work on Android 11 too.
Hossein,1,Not work after update

armaan Khan,1,Keeps telling me that my internet connection is no there when I am using my phone for all the other apps.
Sybolt van der Schoot,1,"This is a really bad app. After losing my main password i re-created my account, on my PC it was no problem to renew the account, but on my mobile device it still asking for security keys, after filling in the key it doesn't accept the keys. What an annoying App. Looking for a mor trustfully password manager this one doesn't work"
manolo teatro,1,I cant login to desktop web browser giving me an unkown error. Tried changing password via finger print enabled mobile app and getting a connection error after clicking change master password... Now it suggests to forget all creds.
Tim Barrett,1,Could not find any way to import passwords from another program. This makes it useless. I have 234 passwords stored I am not going to input them one by one. 3-4-22 Thanks for your reply but I've moved on to another app. But why wouldn't there be an import function inside the app itself like every other password manager? Who's gonna know to go to the website to do that?
Jason Hamer,1,"Great service, but the app is stuck in a log in loop after sms two factor authentication. Update: Unable to get support without paying for a premium license."
A Google user,1,"Doesn't open and keeps on crashing , all my important passwords are inaccessible to me now."
It's me Again,1,Was working great till allll my passwords disappeared
Kevin Melgarejo,1,"Updated: Used to love all Avira apps but pwm has been having so many loading issues recently, I'm moving to another password manager."
TASI FOREX STORE,1,No way to revoke 2FA. You will lost all your passwords forever because avira will fail to send you verification sms
Mr Googley,1,This app is terrible compared with Bitwarden which is free. It tells you if your accounts are safe without paying for a subscription. Your app doesn't save password when you change them either. Sometimes it just logs you out for no reason.
Jake,1,"Great interface and security. However my passwords won't sync between my Macbook and Android device. Would love to change this review if the support team can get in touch, but if the app won't sync then it is essentially pointless"
Hamed Zahedi,1,Deactivate the app on the phone without any notification. I don't even have access to my personal information
A Google user,1,"On my phone I show I have 65 p/w, the same as my computer and when I try open all of them it doesn't show anything. I've already uninstalled and reinstalled still the same results. The first time I put it on my phone it worked but somehow it had gotten uninstalled."
A Google user,1,The app randomly signs me out. Like it resets itself. This has happened 3 or 4 times this year. It is incredibly frustrating and inconvenient. I don't understand why. Is otherwise a fairly solid app in my experience.
A Google user,1,"Does Not Support Device Encryption. I don't care what excuse is used, an App for a security purpose should never effect device encryption. Will not allow screen lock/start up password. Completely pointless."
Stray Cat,1,I enter correct master password but it doesn't work. It says I entered the wrong master password.
Brian Proulx,1,Bad autofill works rarely B Noy
fj fek,1,This app is stealing my accounts information and i can.t inter the app.I have complain from this company.
Murat Tekbaş,1,"As a long-time Avira Prime user, for some reason, I appear to have a login issue with Avira Password Manager. I presume this to be a reoccuring problem, because, this is not the first time that I have come to find myself trying to solve it. Is there a known issue thay is same or similar to the one that I described above?"
A Google user,1,I can't sign in. it's froze on the master password screen. I can't do anything! What have you done with your app!?
Nova,1,Cannot add new login data from click new popup auto fills when the app not yet registered. Must input new data before it. Not like other password manager.
David de Groot,1,Doesn't work for me as the free version cuts the URLs short the the main domain and extension. As a technician user I have a list of subdomain access with different logins. I contact support by Feedback and that leads to the Google play appstore.
ahumadh edm,1,Been locked out by not receiving Verification SMS. And lost all data. No customer support.
Kamal Haddad,1,"I have been using the app for a decent amount of time until today where I instantly uninstalled it. It was the one and only place where I saved my info. Today my amazon account ( the hacker decided to get himself a gift card), discord, Facebook, Instagram, and twitter got hacked and my Instagram's password literally got changed in both the app and in the avira ""password manager""app. Anyways, I hope no one faces that where I had to apologise to almost everyone I know. I couldn't rate 0."
Anthony Nkemakonam,1,"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE I can't access my password manager because I don't receive the verification code sent to my registered phone number after numerous ""resend code"". There is no alternative means of verification. It is an ongoing issue for 3 days now. My registered phone number is still very much active as I receive calls and messages on it. Avira I need my password manager account back so I can back up my passwords elsewhere."
Robert Shay,1,"One day I opened the App, and ALL my info was gone"
Joseph Chen,1,"Junk. Different behaviour on every platform, especially terrible on Android managing logins, new accounts and passwords is especially a chore between apps and websites. Choose something else. The iOS version has a good UX Why don't you just replicate that one?"
A K,1,Cannot login. Not sending SMS OTP. Your 2FA is useless.
Shoban Chiddarth,1,"I cant even type my master password in the entrance page EDIT: Sorry I deleted all of my Avira accounts because the Antivirus added the password manager in my browser. I didnt want the password manager actually and also I gave it a try on mobile if it works. My problem is, What if you got hacked and hackers deleted all the data in your servers(If you claim for encryption so they cant read it)? I have been using Google Password manager from the beginning and Google cant be hacked. So I should stick to it. And it works on mobile without installing any apps and it is inbuilt in chrome and Android."
anas tabiti,1,"Terrible experience , no support"
A Google user,1,I cannot access my account when i need the most. whats going on??
John Tyrrell,1,Total nightmare. Cannot cope with multiple devices

A Google user,1,After update is not working anymore...keep pop up then gone. .its not stable apps
Meghan Galindo,1,"I've been using this for close to a year now and the last time I got on all my passwords were completely gone. Must have been a glitch or something, because it says I haven't made any passwords yet."
A Google user,1,It never worked
Mrs Google,1,"What is going on with your app? All my passwords reverted back to my previous ones, and l had to reset every one. I have unsubscribed. Disgraceful!"
A Google user,1,would be great if the screen didnt freeze everytime I open the app....
Cocomelonia,1,Bad app
Dr. Ajman Mensah,1,"Too bright, makes reading difficult. Needs some themes fast."
Sylvia Foster,1,Interferes with edge
Sam,1,It is constantly making me sign in with both passwords in order to fill a password on another app.
A Google user,1,After Last update unable to login.. Wrong email or password.. Please rectify.. Im login before update but after app itself required login again
Sherri Woodruff,1,"It was working perfectly, today it decided not to allow me to sign in via my fingerprint and when it asks for the master password that is not correct either. Same password I've been using since I set up this app. Now I no longer have access to any of my passwords. This is not acceptable. I m scrambling to figure out 85+ personal and business passwords."
Ashill Jahaly,1,"Idk whats going on, many of my saved noted are not appearing, if i create a new one, the old one appears the. The new one disappears."
S,1,"It was 5 * before I tried to contact support. And got an answer, that only paid products get the support. So make your own conclusions about this company and their attitude."
Mohamed Fathi,1,I cannot login into the app
Tom Passey,1,"APM has stopped syncing on Android. It is forever preparing passwords. Is the issue known and being worked on? EDIT: this has not been fixed, I am now using a different password manager."

A Google user,1,can't even get logged in...
SHEIKH AZHARUDDIN,1,Nice password manager but does not offer any option to save password like bitwarden..please add this feature
David Harnden,1,Can't log in to account.
KJ Live,1,Not working on all app. Sometime it just does not show up when one needs ro auto fill cridentials. I feel like its holding me hostage as opposed to being an assistant toake my life easy. Samsung note 20 ultra
Sanjay Joshi,1,"None of the Avira products are designed to work with Firefox. Browser autofilli service only works for the data hungry Chrome. Avira antivirus also doesn't protect from phishing websites on Firefox. Uninstalled it and I'm very happy with Bitwarden. Because of companies like Avira, the completion in the web browser market is disappearing. They want to support only the leader but not the savior of the open web, only a looser does it. I'm going to get my refund for Prime membership."
David L,1,"Your ""FREE"" program is a joke. Sure, you may indicate breaches in safety, but you DO NOT ALLOW US TO SEE THEM WITHOUT PAYING? You are a bunch of scam artists, like most other virus protection programs. If anyone else is reading this, DON'T BOTHER DOWNLOADING. David L"
